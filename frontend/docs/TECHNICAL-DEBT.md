## Low Priority (Nice to Have)

### 1. Web Vitals Tracking
**Source:** Sprint 6 Performance Optimization
**Status:** Deferred - Quick Wins Only

**Description:**
Add client-side Core Web Vitals tracking (LCP, FID, CLS) for production monitoring.

**Suggested Implementation:**
- Install `web-vitals` library
- Report metrics to analytics or logging service
- Track performance trends over time

---

### 2. Production Monitoring (RUM)
**Source:** Sprint 6 Performance Optimization
**Status:** Deferred - Quick Wins Only

**Description:**
Real User Monitoring to understand actual user experience.

**Suggested Implementation:**
- Integrate Sentry Performance or similar RUM solution
- Track page load times, API latency, errors by user segment
- Set up alerting for performance regressions

---

### 3. E2E waitForTimeout Usage
**Source:** PR #38 Code Review
**Files:** `e2e/helpers/test-helpers.ts`
**Status:** Minor smell - acceptable tradeoff

**Problem:**
`waitForCalendarReady()` uses `page.waitForTimeout(100)` which is generally discouraged in Playwright (fixed waits can cause flakiness or slowness).

**Context:**
The 100ms wait allows React to settle after UI indicators are visible. This is a pragmatic tradeoff - the alternative would be finding a specific element state to wait for, which may not exist for "React finished updating" scenarios.

**If this causes issues:**
- Try removing the wait and see if tests remain stable
- Look for a specific DOM mutation or network request to wait for instead
- Consider using `page.waitForFunction()` to check React's internal state

---

### 4. Unused JavaScript
**Source:** Lighthouse CI (PR #60)
**Status:** Optimization opportunity

**Problem:**
Lighthouse detected unused JavaScript in the bundle.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Analyze with `npm run analyze` to identify large unused modules
- Implement route-based code splitting with `React.lazy()`
- Review imports for tree-shaking opportunities
- Consider dynamic imports for heavy components (e.g., date pickers, modals)

---

### 5. PWA Optimizations
**Source:** Lighthouse CI (PR #60); revisited by the PWA installability story (2026-06-13)
**Files:** `vite.config.ts` (vite-plugin-pwa), `index.html`, `lighthouserc.cjs`
**Status:** Installability polish shipped (Option B); read-only offline data shipped (Option C); offline *writes* deferred

**Shipped — Option B / [PWA installability story](https://github.com/joe-bor/family-hub/blob/main/docs/product/backlog/mobile-ux/pwa-installability.md):**
- Controlled update prompt (`registerType: "prompt"` + `PWAUpdater`) — no more silent reloads
- Sidebar **Install app** affordance (one-tap on Chromium / manual instructions elsewhere / hidden when installed)
- Honest, accessible offline banner (does **not** imply offline data)
- Config cleanups: `stats.html` no longer deployed/precached; dead Google-Fonts CDN cache rules removed; dead Lighthouse `pwa` category removed; manifest/meta description reconciled; modern `mobile-web-app-capable`; orientation unlocked

**Shipped — Option C / read-only offline reads (Issue #222):**
- TanStack Query read cache persisted to IndexedDB via a custom `idb-keyval` `Persister` (`src/lib/offline/`) and `PersistQueryClientProvider`
- Already-fetched calendar/chores/lists/meals/recipes/family data render on cold start and stay viewable offline; never-loaded modules show a clear offline empty state
- Read-only enforced: offline write controls produce no optimistic change, no queued/persisted mutations (`assertOnlineForWrite` in optimistic `onMutate`; `mutations.networkMode: "always"`; `shouldDehydrateMutation: () => false`)
- Cross-account safety: persisted IndexedDB cache + family storage cleared on logout and 401 before reload
- Achieved **without** a Workbox `/api` runtime cache (see Backend Compatibility Notes #3)

**Still deferred — offline writes (PRD §7.5.3, NOT done):**
- Background sync for offline mutations; offline write queue / outbox
- Web Push / notifications

> Note: Lighthouse 12 removed the standalone PWA category; installability is now tracked via manifest/SW checks rather than a Lighthouse PWA score.

## Backend Compatibility Notes

See `.env.example` for environment variable documentation.

### Migration Checklist

**Phase 1: Family Service Layer** ✅ COMPLETED (PR #32)
- [x] Complete familyService abstraction
- [x] All family hooks use TanStack Query
- [x] Both calendar and family ready for backend

**Phase 2: Backend Implementation** ✅ COMPLETED (PRs #83, #87, #89, #96, #105, #106)
- [x] Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to backend URL
- [x] Implement calendar endpoints
- [x] Implement family endpoints
- [x] Remove mock API layer (#106)
- [x] E2E tests run against real backend (#105)

**Phase 3: Authentication** ✅ COMPLETED (PR #35)
- [x] Add auth system (JWT-based with mock API)
- [x] `httpClient` injects auth headers (`src/api/client/http-client.ts`)
- [x] Login screen gates unauthenticated users
- [x] Onboarding includes credentials step (username + password)
- [x] Logout clears auth state and redirects to login

### API Contracts

**Calendar Events** (ready to use):
```
GET    /calendar/events          params: startDate, endDate, memberId
GET    /calendar/events/:id
POST   /calendar/events          body: CreateEventRequest
PUT    /calendar/events/:id      body: UpdateEventRequest (no id in body)
DELETE /calendar/events/:id
```
Types: `src/lib/types/calendar.ts`

**Family** (ready to use):
```
GET    /family                   → ApiResponse<FamilyData | null>
POST   /family                   body: CreateFamilyRequest
PUT    /family                   body: UpdateFamilyRequest
DELETE /family
POST   /family/members           body: AddMemberRequest
PUT    /family/members/:id       body: UpdateMemberRequest (no id in body)
DELETE /family/members/:id
```
Types: `src/lib/types/family.ts`

### Technical Considerations

1. **Member ID Format**: Frontend uses `crypto.randomUUID()`. Backend must accept UUID v4 format without reassigning IDs.

2. **Event-Member Relationship**: ✅ Resolved — Backend uses `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so member deletion automatically removes their events.

3. **PWA API Response Caching**: ⚠️ **Superseded by TanStack Query persistence (Option C, Issue #222).**
   Offline viewing of already-fetched read data is now provided by persisting the
   Query cache to IndexedDB (`src/lib/offline/`), **not** by a Workbox `/api`
   runtime cache. This was deliberate: a service-worker `NetworkFirst` `/api`
   cache would also cache auth/Google-settings responses and photo/binary
   payloads, and offers no per-query allowlist, response validation, or
   per-account clearing — all of which the Query persistence layer provides.
   - **Do not** add a Workbox `/api` runtime cache by default; the previously
     suggested `runtimeCaching` config below is retained only as historical
     context.
   - **Files:** `vite.config.ts` (workbox — intentionally has **no** `/api`
     `runtimeCaching`)
   - **Superseded config (do not apply):**
     ```typescript
     {
       urlPattern: /\/api\/.*/,
       handler: "NetworkFirst",
       options: {
         cacheName: "api-cache",
         expiration: { maxAgeSeconds: 3600 },
         networkTimeoutSeconds: 3
       }
     }
     ```
